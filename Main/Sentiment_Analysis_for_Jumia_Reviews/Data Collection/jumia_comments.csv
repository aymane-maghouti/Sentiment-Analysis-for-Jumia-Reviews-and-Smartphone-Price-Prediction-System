Sound quality is amazing.Easy to use and battery life is good.,-1
"The device is awesome with great bass. But the power should be worked on.  You can turn it off remotely except you leave it discounted  and then goes off after 3mins. There should be a indication that the pods are charging in the case. The ear loops should be made firm and better go avoid looseness causing it to drop off the pods.
Sometimes people find it hard to hear and the noise cancellation is not as strong as advertised.
Apart from that, they are great. I recommend  anyone getting the device.",-1
Just as described,-1

Oraimo dey try well,-1
Nice product.,-1
"Abeg, the price is worth the value! 

First of all, the bass is just so so good and at the same time having a clear, distinct quality sound! When I'm watching Netflix with it, it's as if I'm in cinema + the Environmental Noise cancellation is superb, I didn't even know a gen was on around me, it was when I has removed the earbud I even noticed, to tell you how good it is!

The earbuds are designed so well that you would you even forget an earbud is in your ear! It fits so well.

They definitely didn't lie about battery life,.used it for 4hrs straight and only 50% still remained!

Perhaps, where I would just like them to improve is the touch control, wished it was flat for easier touching. 

But in all....10/10 for this♥️♥️",-1
The sound and lasting battery,-1
As expected just too good,-1
Perfect product,-1

Oraimo my product ????????,-1

It worth the price,-1
Just as advertised,-1

"... has been doing it's work till now.
It's great! It's worth it",-1
"It’s perfect, worth the money, sound it good, easy to understand instruction guide. Only problem I had was one ear wasn’t pairing at first. I fixed it by pairing with the particular ear that want pairing Alone, instead of together, then pairing with the other ear later",-1
I love this earpiece. The bluetooth is apt!,-1
Just like the saying the sound is the difference once you start using this product you will feel the difference in the sound. Don't hesitate to get one for yourself. And I think you guys can had a pouch to it,-1
The experience was on another level,-1
Oraimo is the best,-1
You can't use it for a phone call. The person at the other end won't hear anything you say.,-1
"Was very sceptical in getting it but ended up buying it.
It has a wonderful music production, thou the awareness mood is just a marketing strategy, listening to music on awareness mood doesn't give you the nice music production.

The best,-1
long lasting battery and the sound,-1
"The earpods are good, I mean very good and for it's price I would say it's very fair. Not just the bass but the noise cancellation feature is also top notch.

"Oraimo is the best.... This Earbuds is something else honestly...
The sound is wonderful....
It worth the money",-1
"Awesome product, could do better with a pouch. Impressive bass and battery life. Although, there was error in packaging with the buds. The 3 sizes are all the same, didn't expect that from the official store. Like I said it's a minor packaging error.",-1

"I love the soft tips, and the base is MAD. At least compared to the last version",-1
Works as expected.,-1
Wonderful products,-1
"It’s really nice 
I got what I wanted",-1
It so lovely and nice sounds,-1
Let it have a hook to avoid fall off one's ear.,-1
Good sound,-1
The Item is Good.,-1
It is okay although they can improve the call picking sensitivity as I had to keep tapping twice intermittently before it picks call. Also the requirement to always put the pod into the charging casing in order to reconnect after disconnection is not friendly at all.,-1
Perfecto and has quality sound,-1
"Good quality, crisp sound, great bass",-1
Clear sound quality with great bass. Good battery life. Sensitive audio during calls....no need to shout before being heard from the other end. Certainly worth the price ???? ????,-1
This earbud is very nice and the bass is superb. Cant actually use the full volume cause of my health and safety. The only issue is I would have preferred it a little smaller in size coz I still feel a little pain after some hours,-1
"When i saw the 8 hours music play time, i was initially thinking it was a hype but now that I'm using it, i can conclude that the 8 hrs is an understatement. The bass is also incredible.",-1
I like it,-1
Quality sound. Matches it's price,-1
"It has a good sound, deep bass",-1
"Maybe it's because this is my first, but am loving it.",-1
I love it but just that my ear pains me if the ear piece stays long apart from that I love it,-1
its good,-1
Good product,-1
"Blocks out sound, doesn't let my ear breath but other than that, it's a great buy",-1
"With the way this was advertised you’d think It would at least meet half the features. 

Extremely uncomfortable to wear longer than 30mins

Zero bass unless you smush it all the way into you ears and endure pain

Randomly disconnects 

The only good thing going for this is it’s battery life. 

I do not recommend!
Touch control doesn’t work as it should.",-1
"Nice base, and very good for music, but the microphone is very poor. There's a need for improve on that",-1
Very cool,-1
Is beautiful n sound,-1
Very Nice.,-1
Lovely bass. The very best earbuds,-1
"I love the bass and the long-lasting battery. Though it falls off the ear sometimes, nevertheless it still has a firm stand if fixed properly in the year",-1
Very nice and perfect,-1
The sound production is perfect,-1
The battery lasts all day. Amazing sound. I recommend,-1
Very Quality and I get the value for my money.,-1
Left ear doesn't fit with tendency to fall off while running and within less than a meter it starts to make crackling sounds due to connectivity. Even when charged. Mic picks up surrounding noise and I would still have to raise my voice before I can be completely heard on the other end of the line. It's just aesthetically fancy and averagely works.,-1
The sound is simply out of the world. So impressed with Oraimo on the Freepods 3. Still in doubt? A Trial would convince you.,-1
This is one of the best delivery I've gotten in terms of durability,-1
Easy and convenient,-1
The bass mode is mad,-1
Recommendable,-1
It’s exactly what I ordered,-1
"It's very okay for the price, sound is good",-1
Increase the battery life dats all,-1
Good product,-1
They are great! and the sound? the sound is maad!! it is worth every penny. It also lasts long too asper when its out of the case you can use it for almost a whole day without putting it in the case to charge,-1
Good product,-1
I love it,-1
Been good all round,-1
It's so comfortable and audio is very clear.,-1
Very good,-1
Perfect,-1
It nice and okay,-1
Perfecto,-1
Try making the buds more comfortable.,-1
It's okay,-1
Okay to use,-1
Good purchase,-1
"The sound is really good, though the microphone still needs improvement",-1
Good product,-1
"Highly recommended, super bass, battery last longer than I expected, very comfy for my ears, best call experience so far with it ... The best one out there yet",-1
The pods are a bit loose,-1
"The sound output is super amazing, it last long and charges 0% - 100% pretty damn fast.",-1
It came in fast and it's working well.,-1
"The delivery was fast, it was well packaged and the sound quality and battery life is a blast...",-1
Fantastic battery life. Amazing sound quality,-1
It was very nice,-1
I love everything about it,-1
The battery lasts very long. Third day and I haven't charged.,-1
The sound is so cool,-1
Everything,-1
"I love the battery life and sound quality are both top-notch.
The only reservation I have on the product is that its a bit uncomfortable on the ears after prolong usage.",-1
Perfect,-1
Its user friendly,-1
"I love oraimo products. They are excellent for cheap. The freepods 3 is the best AirPods I ever used including the more expensive one. The design including the packaging is so grand, beautiful and sleek. I fell in love with the sound the first day I put it on and I can say I don’t regret the money and my patience in waiting for it to be delivered. However, I find it very difficult to wear it for long as it is really painful to my ears. 
Apart from that I give it a five stars. 
Thank you oraimo for these wonderful products.",-1
It’s portable and easy to use,-1
Works just fine. They have must thought to correcting mistake touch. All they need to do is to improve the microphone range,-1
Magnificent,-1
"I've read and watched videos on this product, and I got exactly what I expected.
As a budget accessory, it's worth it",-1
Wonderful and fantastic product affordable and modernized,-1
"It serves the purpose 100%. 
I am mostly on the road so I needed a device which I need to charge just once a day n with crystal clear calls. Orimo gave me that at a very good price. Its worth every penny!!!",-1
Very cool sound and good battery life. My only problem with this product is how the black flap keeps plucking in my ears each time I take thee earpods off.,-1
Brings out every sound,-1
Works well with music but keeps cracking and breaking on phone calls. Not a great product despite having a great brand ambassador.,-1
Nice product,-1
Sharp  piece,-1
This product is beyond my expectations. This is world class mehn. Big Ups ORAIMO !!!,-1
"Okay...I'll give it a 5 stars
A week after receiving my Oraimo freepod 3.. I've had no reason to worry....long lasting battery, bass quality top notch.... Fits perfectly in my ears without any sort of pain...doesn't fall off...no regrets spending 13k+ on this",-1
Very nice and cool product,-1
It's looks really good and feels really premium. Worth it.,-1
Worth it,-1
I love the sound quality and Battery life,-1
My client love it and was very happy,-1
"This cheaper and Original, Thanks Jumia",-1
Good noice cancellation and loud.,-1
Sound and design!!,-1
I love it,-1
From the advert I heard on the radio my calls are supposed to be muted to sound around me. But the noise cancellation feature applies to when I'm listening to music only. Maybe I just need to keep exploring. Nonetheless it's perfect.,-1
Practically not a good fit for small ears but the sound is great and it's got a nice bass.,-1
Very sounds n clear,-1
"Charged since it was delivered on Wednesday.
Fantastic sound experience.
A worthy buy",-1
"It's durable,battery and bass is top notch, highly recommended.",-1
"the item is very good. The packaging already gives it this premium look, the bass is mad and the sound quality both on calls and music is very superb. the earphones itself has a very good battery life but the fingerprint function isnt working well, so its difficult to pause and control music from the earphones. you also cant turn it off and on with the earphones so if it automatically turns off when not in use. you have to put it back in the case and take it out again for it to turn on. pls improve on this",-1
The battery is the best I’ve ever seen for Bluetooth AirPods…but it sometimes comes off my ear multiple times due to it being a bit too big and they’re no pouches anywhere ????,-1
Very ok,-1
"The case is unreasonably light, but sound quality is actually good. Don't be deceived by the noise canceling feature it is actually just using the pods with the rubber tips. The bass isn't bad in any way.. They are actually comfortable to wear.",-1
So far so good I'm happy with them,-1
Well its good and all even the bass is great but I'm yet to find out why whenever I turn on the hotspot the music tend to crack and this happens to all oriamo product generally,-1
I love it,-1
"What was advertised was FreePods-3. I ordered it and it was wrapped in a way I couldn't see the exact product. 
So I took it home only to go and meet FreePods-2.",-1
Really nice,-1
"The bass is awesome, the battery life is wonderful.
Oraimo is always the best…",-1
"It is cool...
Perfectly fits your eardrums with a long lasting battery.",-1
"The Quality, great. The duration, splendid.
It's a money well spent.
Again, I love it",-1
"Simply the baddest, Coolest, tightest earbuds I have ever used.
Sound clarity with just the level of bass is next to none... So long as I have experienced it",-1
"I like it, sound production perfect ????",-1
Great. No complaints so far,-1
It wasn't up to one month after I bought them sef and the battery of the right bud is dead so I can only use one now.,-1
Long lasting battery capacity,-1

The bass is superb,-1
The sound quality is superb,-1
It lasts for long hours and the sound is perfect.,-1
It is serving its purpose,-1
"Good sound, good connectivity. Only complaint may be wearing comfort",-1
"I love the sound it produces, I love that it goes really well with calls but the reason I'm not giving it 5 starts is solely for the inability to move to the next music in your playlist when playing songs.",-1
Battery life,-1
Earpod sound very good with nice  bass.,-1

The product is so cool men damn!!!,-1
Satisfactory,-1
Awesome ????????????,-1
Great sound quality. High and low frequencies are well balanced here. Good battery life and good build for the price.,-1
Was basically as described.... Good product,-1
Provision or improvement for smaller ears,-1
"The earphone is a good one, but needs to be improved in design by the manufacturer to ensure it's a good fit for most and does not easily fall out, while the ear muffs are not too large and are a best fit too.
Overall, it's a fine.",-1
"Just got my item yesterday 1 Jan 2022, have been checking it’s sound quality ever since up until now I have not been disappointed hence am loving the product. Thanks Oraimo for giving us value for our money.",-1
"I love it, loud, good bass and fitting",-1
Has a very rich bass and a clean sound quality. ????????,-1
Very nice. So enjoying it,-1
I like the fact that I can use it for 3 days without worrying about charging It... That's an A+ from me to Oraimo,-1
"I hesitated buying the unit due to the cost which i though was high compared to cheaper quality models i had seen, but then - the battery life. So i went ahead.

Really, this unit cant be real. the functionality and sound quality are UNBELIEVABLE. With music i have known over the years, i now hear things in them (demons ??).

unit is worth every kobo if your 1. love music  2. love gadgets   3. Need talk for ages   4. KIS",-1
"Awesome bass ???? ???? ????????, highly recommended!",-1
Long lasting battery and Noise cancellation,-1
"Sound quality is okayish with excellent bass, environmental noise cancelling isn't as good as it thought it would've been, I had no problem making calls, no complaints with bluetooth connection through my usage so far",-1
Good quality,-1
It was do good,-1
"So lovely, nice bass",-1
Perfect,-1

Probably next on should come with a charging head.",-1
It’s in good condition and the bass is awesome,-1
Love the extra bass.,-1
The Overall Quality Performance ✌????,-1
It’s a good product. I am really enjoying it,-1
Is good,-1
Most def,-1
It’s good.,-1
The earbud meet the requirements. The bass is top-notch but the only problem is that it pains in the ear after some minutes.,-1
Best product I have had from oriamo,-1
The design is very pretty and the sound balance is awesome. I like the bass especially. Off course the battery is trusted,-1
The Pod makes real sense But the awareness mode makes no sense bcos you can barley call it quality earphone. But with the bass mode you have a good quality Pod. .So it's better to leave it at it is and use it like that on bass mode,-1
"Well ear fitting aside that
 it's ok",-1
"The sound is good and it matches the video, it doesn't lag",-1
"It sounds great, However it falls out of the ear which is quite disappointing. Another disappointing surprise is that you can't put it off or on from the airpods, you have to return it to the case. Sound quality is good and the noise canceling work well too.",-1
Exactly what I ordered,-1
"Really good. Quality sound.
Just that the rubber tips start to hurt my ears after a long while of usage, and I’m using the small size.",-1
It's just as I expected it,-1
Nice sound,-1
"I have both the freepods 2 & 3 2Baba. The Freepods 3 is a superb upgrade from the 2. 

Though the 3 lacks enough bass for music. I'm not an audiophile, but I enjoy my music, and the lack of bass it's obvious. 

The Freepods 3 shines through with it's connectivity. 

Calls are clear, and the latency is very impressive compared to Freepods 2. 

For me, Freepods 2 is a lot lighter and comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The Freepods begin to become uncomfortable after a few hours.",-1
There is a great improvement from the last edition. The comfort and sound quality is so nice.,-1
Great product,-1
"Looks smart, with a great sound",-1
"Delivered as seen 
Enjoying my music",-1
I’ve been looking for an affordable and comfortable earbud. Invested so much on different types until I found this. This output is perfect with great noise cancellation. I do wear this for hours with ease.,-1
Good product,-1
Love it,-1
Is very nice ???? am enjoying it and i will still buy another one because the product is the best amongst the best,-1
It worth the money. I guess money well spent,-1
"This is a top-class product. The bluetooth range is just as described. I could go away from my phone as far as tens of metres away, with doors closed, yet the production is steady. The bass mode is great. The call quality, even in super noisy environs, is smooth and clear.

It is absolutely worth every penny!",-1
Battery is very strong,-1
"I’m happy with it so far
Better than AirPods 2",-1
"This product is just simply amazing

Only Apple product has achieved this feat and Oraimo showed that perfection can redefined.

Amazing ????",-1
The bass is fireeee ????.. Good stuff,-1
The ear buds were perfect,-1
This product is amazing,-1
It’s okay but it’s so unfortunate that’s one of the EarPods came out of my ear and fell down on the road Nd got broken,-1
I love it ...the base and product is ok...I hope it lasts too,-1
Good battery life,-1
"It has good quality sound, plus heavy bass.",-1
Mad base.. Long lasting battery too,-1
"This pods are awesome, the battery never dies..... Excellent product glad I bought it",-1

It’s really nice????,-1
"Great sound, lasts long",-1
Got it for a friend and he loves it,-1
Packaging and quality.,-1
After one week of usage the left earpod refused to charge,-1
"The product is not responding to touch when picking calls or using it to next music,and most time if am talking to someone on phone the hardly hear me well I regret buying there better product like edifier , and qcy",-1
"The sound is Superb truth be Told. But I am scared it may fall off my hear because the hold firm and assuring. Also the touch sensor hasn't been perfected, but the Output is Highly impressive for the Price",-1
"I was surprised when I saw the ad. I thought 8hrs with great sound quality was a lie. But let me tell you, this Freepods meet all the advertisement hype. It is worth spending your money on.",-1
I love it and the bass is awesome,-1
"For the first time, I enjoyed what I ordered from jumia, FreePods-3 is the best earpod with perfect sound and nice package design, infact you'll fall in love with the pack even before you open it. I strongly recommend this to any and every one. I promise you'll enjoy it.",-1
The sound is good,-1
It's just perfect,-1
It's best pod with the price,-1
The pod is heavenly. You hear every lyric and every instrument from beats clearly. I am glad I bought it.,-1
It's perfect,-1
The bass is cool and it is easier to answer calls than pod2. The only downside is that it pains the ear when it stays for long,-1
Make sense,-1
Easy function,-1
I recommend,-1
Top quality,-1
"I've been using this for about 7days and I can say that the battery is cool. However, I seem to be having some challenges with the mouthpiece when I'm making/receiving calls, as I need to repeat myself in some cases before the other person can hear me.",-1
Good product,-1
Nice product,-1
It's jst what I ordered I saw ????????,-1
It’s doesn’t feet in my ears,-1
The earbuds works perfectly and I would recommend for others to use. Just not compatible with kinda of earholes. A variety of white would be much appreciated.,-1
Unbelievable performance. Bass was like nothing before. Big upgrade from the old version,-1
Make sense,-1
The Earbuds are just super amazing..,-1
Is fine,-1
"Battery last long and great sound, I love it",-1
dope and long lasting,-1
Perfect,-1
Breathtaking,-1
Good sound but the power pack is behaving somehow. The light in the middle is very dim while others are bright,-1
More adaptable to ear not to allow frequent fall off,-1
I love it,-1
"The sound is very decent for the price point. The bass is good, vocals of artistes is clear, not as crisp as I would want it but expected for this price point. The biggest win is with calls, the receiver can hear you clearly even when your voice is low. A good buy!",-1
"The sound quality is great,apart from a small discomfort  in the ear.",-1
Best you can get,-1
Working perfectly and that battery also last,-1
"Everything about this bud is taintlessly beautiful, I pray it lasts long, so I can continue to advertise it to fam.",-1
Keep doing the good,-1
This earpiece is gives me so much value than it is actually worth. It's sound is so refined and balanced. It's a must buy for every music lover!,-1
I love it????,-1
"Awesome bass.. 
Very quick connectivity
Lasting battery",-1
durable battery and best sound its a good buy quality service from oraimo,-1
"Excellent bass, quality products",-1
"The device sometimes have difficulty of people hearing me when on calls
The left ear is now making noise as if the speaker is bad
Finally when playing music after sometimes it will be disconnecting and connecting back
U only enjoy the bass when u are in an environment where their is no noise
I only enjoyed it the first 2 weeks of purchase",-1
"Nice battery, good sound.",-1
"The Product is really good, the sound quality is nice, its sleek and portable. but the size of the eartips isn't okay, it hurts my ears despite changing the eartips to the smallest ones. I also think it should be customizable, we should be able to configure the earbuds to our taste. I personally think a double tap on the right ear should change it to the next song instead of pausing it, if I could have been able to change that, it would have been great. Great product oraimo, keep getting better!⚡",-1
The design and other things mentioned  in the ad for this product is just as described. Amazing bass and goo sound quality,-1
"ONE MONTH REVIEW...So, while the Earpods are durable and the bass is great I think they need to look into the quality of the connectivity,  says its 10m but often time behaves like 3m span. Every other  thing is good",-1
"Good product, loud and noise reduction",-1
"The Earbuds are very good, fits perfectly into both ears giving good Quality Sounds, the Voice is clear during Phone calls",-1
Very good,-1

Nice Bass,-1
"Have been enjoying my freepods since the Day of purchase, great sound and no issue eversince",-1
"Honestly, this product is overrate. I have a regular ear pod that  I got for 4k and there is no difference comparing both.",-1
It’s worth the buy,-1
It’s okay,-1
Nice product. Just painful to my ear.,-1

"It makes a lot of sense, although the noise cancellation does not work perfectly as I expected but it's still a lot better.",-1
Spot on,-1
It’s ????,-1
"I dnt think the active noise cancellation is working, as the Bluetooth doesn’t filter noise as  I thought, and mouth piece doesn’t pick sound as it shuld.",-1
The freepods-3 2baba is giving me joy... its a boom sha sha,-1
Unbelievable sound quality,-1
"Well, after some usage for a month now, the Pod 3 beats my presumption from the battery life to the sounds(beats) to the packaging and the rage it covers even the designs and clarity while making calls, and my favorite parts are the packaging, design and sounds output while the ear tips are on BUT they’re sets back which I find as a big deal and got me wondering (1) You have to manually select it to the pod during calls including incoming calls which doesn’t make it totally wireless because I have to bring out my phone (2) lately they’re breaks in transmission while usage(music) for a second or two which i find annoying at times. However the Oraimo pod 3 is a nice purchase!",-1
"Nothing, I love it so much,it went well with my phone,no issues,bass is top notch and awareness mode is great too.",-1
"The bass is something else. Very nice

The bass is something else. Very good

"Great sound, cool when used for calls, long lasting battery",-1
Good sound definition overall,-1
It’s been good so far ….this is my first time using an oraimo product too so it’s good,-1
"It's perfect and all that ,but I can't sleep with it",-1
"The sound quality is 11/10. Very good. But the buds still have its faults. First of all, the silicon tips on the buds sometimes slip out but they can be swapped with smaller ones that come in the box.

Secondly, the touch sensors are a bit too sensitive , so things start happening without your intention.

Other than that , it’s still very solid.",-1
Good Product.,-1
Excellent,-1
"It's solid

It's solid",-1

Very strong battery and nice sound.,-1

The second one I'm buying... Top notch quality as usual.,-1

The battery life is top notch. One pod fell into water a few days after I got them. It still works like a charm.,-1
nice product,-1
D beat,-1
Best product ever,-1
Great Product. and Amazing stereo. but lack the power on functionality which i have to put it back into the case.,-1
"This is the second time am buying, but can't figure how to increase and decrease the volume",-1
"After a week of purchase, one of the ear isn't working.
The one that doesn't work today will work tomorrow and vise versa versa... Stopped using it",-1
"it has so much bass, and sound quality is good too. I won't advise to wear for too long as it causes ear ache",-1
"But it should have an app to control and set the ear pod. Eg to set the audio volume , to set the bass , to change song or to do other stuff... But the air bud is good and superb.",-1
"Nice sound. Very light, but not prone to very rapid head motions or the bluetooth will disengage.",-1
Good product. though I need to reset my bass if that's a thing. bought one for my hubby too and he likes it,-1
It’s okay,-1
I think the product meets requirement.,-1

"It's worth the money, sound is mad",-1
"Is working fine  it sounds laundry and clearly, I really like it and and am enjoying it.",-1
"This product is everything they described it to be and more, the bass on this piece is an upgrade on the freepods 2 for sure, i charged the case the day I received it and it was  5days later before i had to charge again, aside the pain you feel after a long time of having the pods on, its almost perfect.
Though i barely use both pods at the same time, maybe that's why it could stay for up to 5days before dropping to one bar on the case. ????",-1
The bass mode,-1
"Feels good, sounds good, looks good. Good for the price",-1
Only wish I can control the volume on the pods without touching my phone or other device,-1
Sound is top notch,-1
It’s sounds well,-1
It's nice though I have not used it,-1
Works well,-1
"This item is awesome,  an upgrade to 2,this 3 is the bomb",-1
Nice product,-1
I love the product,-1
Love that bass! Great range. Would have preferred a feminine voice saying 'connected',-1

If you’re considering getting this, go ahead",-1
It make sense. Toms up,-1
I'll recommend this product,-1
It's a great product,-1

It’s alright,-1
It has a great sound and voice clarity. I don't need to shout before they can hear me.,-1
Punchy bass but expected more functionality,-1
Okay for the price,-1
Perfect!!!!,-1

This earbud's battery is quite remarkable. I haven't charged it in 3 days now and I use it more than 8hrs daily . The sound is mind blowing for those of us that like that woofer sound. Mad Basssss!,-1
"Well, using it for over a month or less, everything is perfect, but the tips are not ear compact able, the tips wear out easily and come off, I feel more comfortable using it without the tips but at the expense of good bass",-1

Works perfectly well,-1
It needs to be louder,-1
The sound quality is nice and the battery is top notch,-1
The earbud is working perfectly. Wow! I love it.,-1

The product is so lovely and wonderful,-1
Good quality sound. And the battery last well enough. I’m still tying to get used to the awkward soft-touch call answering buttons though. Good overall,-1

"Nice sounds, although I am getting used to it. I liked the user interface of the pods 2",-1
"The bass could be better, and the sound clearer at high volume. I don't really enjoy music with it, but it great with games and movies. It's great for calls too. One of the best devices I've made calls with.. A great device overall, especially for its price.",-1
It's fine,-1
The item is fine. Thanks,-1

When I return the two ear to the power bank the Bluetooth is supposed to go off but one way or the other it will connect it’s self even in the bank and closed,-1
"It's good, sound well. But it's Bluetooth connection is too weak for a 5.2 version. The freepods disconnects while making calls all the time(whether it's Internet call or gsm call)",-1
I love oraimo,-1
Enjoying the Oraimo earpod 3,-1
"The output is great. However, I experience a little lag with answering phone calls.",-1
It very portable.  Noise canceling,-1
"The battery lasts long, the quality of the sound is great, however, the earpods can hurt your ears after a couple of hours of wearing them. The way the thing sits in the ear can be improved.",-1
Very cool and good sound,-1
Lovely,-1
The facts that oraimo made it sound so good,-1
It's very good,-1
I really love it,-1
Durability,-1
The quality of the sound,-1

I love the bass,-1

Once fully charged the airport can last more than a week..",-1
Perfect,-1
Good and quality product. But only connects to one device at a time. It is too big to the ear. Works fine anyway.,-1
love the bass ????????????,-1
The feeling is dope,-1
Very nice. Exactly as it should be. Amazing sound quality,-1
Sweet pure bass with tips on,-1
"Classy and great sounds


It's stylish and clear sound",-1
Mehnnnn… the experience has just been amazing.,-1
I like the sound production but it can be painful to the ear after a long time.,-1
"It has just 1.5 seconds lag but asides that, it's really good. I love it",-1
Sound is cool,-1
So far there have been no issues unlike the free pods 2,-1
"Sounds good, battery life is great. Looks good too and fits in my ears tightly (not to an uncomfortable level).",-1
Perfect sound quality.,-1
You still have to raise your voice to be heard clearly on a call.,-1
"Been a long time I've been so impressed about a product, incredible battery life good sound and call quality, would recommend without thinking best in class in it's price range and also gives the more premium headset a run for their money.just one draw back the ear tips are highly uncomfortable you can keep it on for more than an hour without feeling so uncomfortable find myself removing them every time",-1
Bt pains d ear's if stayed for so long,-1
Nothing,-1
Good product,-1
The 2baba freepods 2  overall better with good casing that doesn’t scratch and clear sound and base but the 2baba freepods 3 is just sleeker looking with better coating and Type C port in the case.,-1
I can't use apps like Shazam to detect songs while using the pods and it sometime doesn't quicky connect,-1
"No issues, enjoying my new freepods and the battery lasts.",-1
"I like it ,",-1
"So far it hasn't disappointed. Battery life seems good, but it sucks that the earbuds don't have volume control. Also, the shape of the ""awareness mode"" tend to hurt my ears. And finally, true wireless earbuds that actually pick my small voice on phone calls. Most other earbuds don't pick my voice over background noise because I have a small phone voice. But this one does, without me having to shout!",-1
"The sound is dope.
But I'm unable to pair 2 devices at the same time.",-1
"Nice sound output but I feel like the noice cancellation isn’t all that and also the fact that when a call comes in, I have to manually switch to my EarPods even while it’s connected to phone can be tiring ….overall it’s a good product for the price",-1
good product enjoying it,-1
"This is my second one in 2 weeks. Gave my wife the first and had to get another and I must say, so far so good. Sound is good with good stuff and this is good stuff",-1
Nice sound but mic keeps disconnecting during calls,-1
I enjoyed it. Working fine,-1
"Nice fits, portable and beautiful bass.
The FreePods-2 had a function to increase and decrease volume but unlike the FreePods-3 which doesn’t have such functions.",-1
Very clear sound when making calls which is what I have been looking for in a long time,-1
"Its the original one. Good battery over 6+hrs, Top notch sound quality. Its lovely.",-1
Oraimo did a great job. I love it Review here:  YouTube.com/PaulTechie,-1
Very nice,-1
The bass is really nice and loud. The battery lasts very well.,-1

Love the bass,-1
"The bass is as advertised, nice audio filtering.",-1

Nice product,-1
"The product is good so far 
I’m enjoying it",-1
"Beautiful design. Quality sound, though the bass could still be better. Battery life is alright. Not being able to customize touch control can be frustrating but is manageable. Overal good product.",-1
"It's worth every penny, the long lasting hours, the fast charging and even the light weight.",-1
Really nice sound quality and punchy bass,-1
Super bass,-1
Very Good,-1
"This is my first earbuds experience.
It looks pretty cool, the design is spectacular.
The sound quality is great, especially the bass.
For a bass lover this is phenomenal, the best part is the bass is outstanding but it doesn't drown out the highs and mids.
I wouldn't for outdoors/busy environments with the ear tips on (bass mode).
The ear tips block out external sounds and amplify the bass, almost sounding like strong headphones.
Without the ear tips you can't get much bass which sucks but you would be able to hear what's happening around you and it feels a bit lighter on the ear without the tips.
I haven't used it long enough to say more but it's quite authentic for the price range, it's a good buy",-1
"It is as described 
I like it",-1
It works very well and worth the hype.,-1
Confirmed Product! Dis really amazed nice one from Oriamo.,-1
"It the best 
Worth the price",-1
It fit's and stays on both ears. Finally,-1
Not too comfortable with my ear but the sound quality is pretty good,-1
It's actually really good. But no volume increase or decrease on the freepods themselves.,-1
"You would think the FreePods 3 would be an entire upgrade to the FreePods 2 but no, some features were removed like the Power feature and other stuffs but still a solid 7/10",-1
Just that I'm finding it hard to pick calls or redail. I just need to study it well. Perfect,-1
Lovely product,-1
Super sound!,-1
"It has good sound, got what i ordered for. Its worth the price",-1
Awesome,-1
The product is impressive,-1
"Awesome sound, bass and battery. Causes pains to the ears occasionally. Aside that, Perfect",-1
Beautiful product and Very nice,-1
Worth the value,-1
"I like the sound quality, the bass is okay, the call quality can be better,",-1
It's very good as advertised.,-1
The position in ear is not fashionable,-1
Nice quality,-1
It’s perfect!,-1
it's cool,-1
The sound quality and tge battery life is great,-1
Bass is amazing ????,-1
It's strong an excellent.,-1
The comfortability of the pods and the bass is an improvement from the previous version,-1
Noise cancellation,-1

Terrible delivery.... but the buds are cool though,-1
"Auto connect, and the good and sound output",-1
The bass,-1
The environmental noise cancellation works perfectly fine.,-1

The oraimo freepod 3 is the best with good sound and long lasting battery,-1
Excellent,-1
Fantastic sound and sleekp,-1
Like the Bass.,-1
"It was perfect, exactly like  the same item displayed",-1
Worth it,-1
"People calling me can hardly hear me using the FreePods-3 2Baba. I will have to remove it and use my phone directly.

And this isnt good enough because i did not purchase this for just music alone.  so sad I did purchased it.",-1
I like how it feels on my ear,-1
Well the freebuds' right ear keeps coming out.,-1
"My only problem with it is that after the earbuds have been in your ears a while, it starts hurting. Maybe y'all could make the next design a tad smaller. It is otherwise amazing",-1
Am totally in love with d product. Its everything I want in an earbuds,-1
Not a bad product and was delivered on time,-1
It's worth the price.,-1
Perfect,-1
Great sound and battery life is long lasting. I highly recommend this product.,-1
Very very good i love oraimo products,-1
"I'm not trying to over hype it oo but this is one of the best earpods I've ever come across, connectivity is perfect, the sound especially the base is excellent, the battery is outstanding, the Bluetooth distance is superb and it's rugged. Oraimo products are basically built for Nigerians.",-1
The new design is flawless,-1
It's awesome,-1
"Noise cancellation, solid and sleek appearance, clarity of sound, durability of battery...all round excellence. Oraimo is always on point.",-1
"The bass is super excellent,",-1

The ba3 life,-1
"The ""boom""!",-1
It works perfectly. Dope bass and cool charging case.,-1
Get one and find out more...,-1
Nice product,-1
Key functionalities are missing compared to Pod 2.,-1
The product is great. The sounds without the buds should be improved as well.,-1
"The free touch is probably not sensitive enough. Cos you have to tap several times before it responds. But the sound is great, The battery power is amazing and the grip is perfect... It hardly falls off (I once used it to run in the rain. It didn't fall of and the water had absolutely no effect on it).",-1
"Nice, it works fine",-1
It's a very good product,-1
Seems battery life isn't portrayed correctly though,-1
Nice battery life. Not too strong in the ears. But a decent product.,-1
Increase the Bluetooth connection range,-1
"Sometimes people complain about not hearing me properly, besides that, the sound quality is top notch.",-1
It does the work for an average priced freepods. The ear fit is good too.,-1
"ok, i like it",-1
It is clear enough,-1
"Great value for money. Does what it is suppose to do.
You just need to to improve the latency, add ANC and an app to tweak the pod settings. Overall and excellent product considering its price",-1
The bass is something else. Get your Oraimo free pod 3 today,-1
perfect bass and long battery life,-1
"Really great sound quality from oraimo
Love it!",-1
"Great sound, the case looks good too. Overall great user experience",-1
It’s very great...I call it my wife,-1
The  noise control and the bass is the best so far,-1
This Bluetooth device has nice sound and also lasts long.,-1
I like it,-1
"It's an awesome improvement compared to FreePods2. Just realised I've been wearing them wrong since I got them 2 days ago. I mistakenly figured it out today and this bass they worked on is ????
They even removed that annoying ""Disconnected"" and ""Batri loooow!"" that Tuface says in FreePods2 ????",-1
The ear buds works just perfectly fine????.. The battery life nah mad oh! Nice one from Oraimo????,-1
It's just what I needed. Thanks,-1
"This was a good buy, I don’t regret it one bit  highly recommended if you fancy bass",-1
"Nice 
 I love it",-1
"AMAZING PRODUCT, AMAZING DEAL, AMAZING DELIVERY SPEED!!! I couldn't say less. Thank you for the Service, Jumia.",-1
Good item,-1
"This right here is beautiful and the sound is awesome, you can hear tiniest instruments",-1
I like the bass of the device. It's really cool,-1
Great product,-1
Good freepod,-1
Long lasting ????,-1
It's sounds very good and it's portable,-1
The bass is nice and sound very well,-1
"Product was well packaged and delivery was fast. Good bas;, battery lasts long enough and it fits perfectly well into the ear. 
Value for money.",-1
"Very awesome, battery last long on average volume... Also has powerful bass. Like the design it's sliq, It's a very good product u won't regret the purchase. Also come with good packaging too.",-1
Works like fire ????????????,-1

"The bass, the fit and the design, top notch",-1
I love the new AirPod,-1
I love it,-1
The quality,-1
"Amazing bass and surround sound
I could hear the singers thoughts even",-1
Sound quality is very good.,-1
The sound is something else and is so clear when making call,-1
Thumbs up,-1
I????It ....Wonderful,-1
Hubby loves it and it's working well,-1
Mad output... best buy so far. The water resistant part is not so true tho because mine started having slight issues after it fell into a bucket of water but I'm still impressed by its overall performance and battery life.,-1
I like it,-1
It's nice,-1
"It’s looks like Freepod 0, too loud, no bass, it disconnect at will, lack sensitivity. I advise you buy the Freepod 2 rather than 3, it’s a poor work put together I see it like a downgrade. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS LIKE I DID.",-1
It’s cool,-1
Great product with clear bass sound. Battery also last long,-1
It's working optimally so far.,-1
"The battery capacity is manageable though. Aside that, the base is nice, you can answer calls with it but the phone has to be very close to you for the person to hear clearly.",-1
"I don't know if the pods have a mouthpiece though cuz I tried making a call without holding my phone and the other person could barely hear not until I brought the phone closer to me Asides that, music and every other thing has been great.",-1
Perfect so far. Providing DIFFERENT SOUNDS,-1
"Considering the price, these freepods 3 deliver. An audiophile might not consider buying this but a regular human would, to get a bit of beyond average music experience. That said, the ENC is not a solid home run; I wasn't not expecting it to (price factor). It suffers connectivity issues with my laptop mostly and latency with both laptop and phone (at least on my devices). That said, good frequency response and great battery life at the price.",-1
"Comfortable to wear, the sound quality is impressive and the noise cancelling feature works",-1
it's very ok,-1
It's good for the price,-1
The only reason it got a 4 star is because of how it fits. I have to constantly push it in before it stays. It’s a good product overall,-1
I love it die,-1
Nice sound,-1
"It’s exactly what I wanted and I really love that
And the delivery of the product was super fast✨",-1
Nice Bass. Good Battery,-1
The bass is super great. Working perfectly. No complaints at all.,-1
"Bass/sound is good, quality good, battery excellent, ENC work very well,I would definitely recommend you get this 10/10",-1
I I has the kind of bass I've been looking for,-1
It's not perfect. But it's obviously a short term choice.,-1
"Sound was so good. Perfect, everything about it is good. 

Cool to use on ear.",-1
"Great buy. Bought it for cheap too, so value for money! Mic picks up voice during calls way better than the freepods2. Better audio, better fit, better battery life.",-1
Perfect,-1
Best Ever,-1
"It has an amazing battery life, fits in the ear and the bass is okay.. 
The cons is that it has no active noise cancellation though can pretty block noises around you a little bit. But when you're in public like say in the road, you will notice the missing ANC. 
Totally it's worth the price... The battery is amazing. I used it a full day and only charged once.
Worth the buy!",-1
Oraimo is the best ????????????. I love it,-1
I totally love the bass. Great upgrade from the Freepods 2.,-1
Quality buds,-1
This oraimo freepods-3 i can say is better than freepods-2. I like the 2 modes it has and the battery life is good,-1
I love the packaging and the freepods works well.,-1
Oraimo outdid themselves with this one. I'm even more impressed with the battery life. The sound clarity is on another level,-1
Great bass… I love it,-1
"The notice cancelation works the bass, trebel works very well, the battery lasts long, so yh it's a great buy",-1
great product from oraimo,-1
Sounds great,-1
Oraimo to the world,-1
Works fine easy to connect... but has approximate 1.7s lag so sometimes when u pause take almost 2s to do that same as when u play... used it for my COD mobile game and I'll shoot like 2s before I start hearing the sound... apart from that quality device,-1
Clear sound.... Nice fit... Great design ????,-1
Lovely,-1
"Awesome bass on this one.

"Nothing special about it,
Just some regular headset...",-1
nice for the price. the issue i have is that it stops and continues without any major obstruction of the Bluetooth connection,-1
It is lovely good sound quality and lasting battery,-1
Is ok but sometimes it use to pain in the ear,-1
"It is better than what I expected. Though, the ears from me are not that fitting but it is still manageable. I love the bass",-1
What you pay for is what you get..  the price and quality go hand in hand,-1
"The Bass and audio quality is great , the mic is good but I do get complains sometime of not being heard clearly sometimes",-1
Good sound quality for call and music,-1
"It works okay, however the additional earplugs are quite uncomfortable.",-1
Very good,-1
"It is indeed top notch and one of the best of its kind,i only observed that there is no volume control on the araiom freepod3  earbuds which was one of the features i really enjoyed in the freepid2 verson.",-1
"It's lows and high are evenly tuned and it volumes can be high, but not too sure of its environmental noise cancellation",-1
"Good product , could do well with a better tap setting and noise cancellation",-1
The ergonomic design is not good enough,-1
Satisfactory,-1
The product is nice,-1
Hi hi hi,-1
"You just gotta love this product! . The bass is perfect, and the product Itself is equitable, enjoyable, useful and usable.",-1
Good sound,-1
What I requested was what I got….all thanks to oraimo,-1

Excellent,-1
It's okay,-1

"The Bass is like you are in a studio.
I love it. Nice one jumia",-1
very good quality product...only lame/annoying part is tuface's voice as he says 'connected' lol,-1
I love the 2 pod 3 I love the sound soft and nice with balanced bass,-1
Additional increase in sound,-1
It was worth buying.,-1
The EarPods are great but when using the rubber tips they are quite uncomfortable to wear.,-1
a good upgrade to freepods 2,-1
Ok okok,-1
I enjoy the product.,-1
Awesome. Product,-1
The sound,-1
The bass is super,-1
"It’s not painful in ear. The sound quality and base also very good. It holds a charge and lasts over 5 hours use with a charge. You don’t need to continually charge the case. A day’s charge can last more than 24 hours for you to keep recharging the EarPods 

I love the black colour.",-1
Quality stuff,-1
Very lovely,-1
Nice product,-1
The left earbud stop charging after getting low I put in back in the case too be charge but it doesn't last long after two song,-1
It's pretty good but the left ear bud isn't responding  to touch,-1
Does everything mentioned but the bass and the enc could be better,-1
"It’s a great product but they could include other features like ear detection, volume control in subsequent productions.",-1
They are ok,-1
Nice bass,-1
Not bad. But could be better,-1
"Best product so far I love this


Thanks oraimo for making this possible",-1
I fucking love it,-1
Super bass to bad!! Fits into ears perfectly and the touch control .,-1
Omorrr… just buy it … you won’t regret it,-1
It’s good,-1
The battery life,-1
With good bass and comfortable in the ear. It's worth the price.,-1
"great product, nice sound",-1
Perfect product,-1
"Yes, you should buy. The product is rated as it is. Thank you Oraimo! You guys are really doing a great job producing quality products.",-1
Awesome,-1
"I think there should be an app for the buds. Battery life is great, fit is great and sound it great.",-1
So much wonderful..I love it,-1
the sound is great. more comfortable than most earphones.,-1
It is ok,-1
"When my younger sister used it, she screamed in amazement. This one’s the best I’ve used. The sound quality is 100% and the battery is strong too.",-1
Bass quality,-1
"Well it doesn't fit in that much tho, which they need to improve on.
But i love the product.",-1
Awesome,-1
Perfect sound,-1
It's working fine and give me what I need,-1
"Is all d very best earbud I have u from oraimo, everything bigger and better than the previous model",-1
Great product,-1
Feel so good to use,-1
Exactly as advertised,-1
"Not the perfect bass, but has a good battery life 7/10 in my opinion",-1
A good buy,-1
Battery life should last longer and increase in the base a little bit,-1
It's a great product from oraimo,-1
"The Bass is very powerful,oraimo keep the good work.",-1
Very good,-1
Perfect sound,-1
"Excellent sound, long lasting battery life and great build quality. I would buy again in a heartbeat!",-1
"nice sound????, love it????. but Oraimo pls make the pouch avaliable pls.❤️",-1
Perfect sound,-1
"Durable, efficient and long battery life",-1
"The bass is not from here
It makes mad sense and the battery is strong",-1
It’s pretty nice and very good output,-1
Awesome sound production. I only had issues with it fitting into my very small ear.,-1
"The bass is something else. This is what I've always wanted. Oraimo rocks. But it would have been more cute if it had noise cancelation. All the same, I love it. ????????????????????????",-1
Best for the price,-1
Very Good,-1
Simply Great!!!!,-1
Oraimo really did well with this than the previous one. The base is so go and I really enjoyed it.it's also comfortable in the ear.,-1
fantastic,-1
The free pods 3 have great quality like most oraimo products with very good bass but after a while of using them the only issue I have is that once in a while I have connection issues. I feel like it has something to do with the three minutes auto shutoff time when not in use though but aside from that they are worth the money,-1
Cancellation of noise to the nearest minimum,-1
Everything works as described,-1
Impressive,-1
"This is by far the best from oraimo, stays on you ears, sounds better, although the latency is the biggest issue but only when playing call of duty so that's not even a downside..!!",-1
"Overall amazing product, the touch controls are just quite insensitive .",-1
Absolutely awesome and superb,-1
The product is excellent,-1
I love the sound quality and it's battery last for almost a day. I'm happy I bought it,-1
Good sound quality,-1
The earbuds do not fit perfectly,-1
Battery last longer than expected,-1
"I have to say I really love this earbuds so  much, anyone that has the mind of purchasing it or not . I am here to tell you to go for it.  It's worth every money I spent on. The bass is what I love the most about it and the sleek design, it's portable and cute in the ear. I have to say  it is the best earbuds ever????. You won't regret. I hardly do reviews but this made me so happy ???? I had to do this one.",-1
Good product,-1
I love this product,-1
Highly recommend for everyone.,-1
The earbuds is good for it price. Has a solid long lasting battery and good mic but the noise cancellation is not that great.,-1
"Great Upgrade from the previous version. 

Better Bass, Noise Cancelation, and great call clarity. 

I was able to get great value for my money.",-1
The bass is bass,-1
Sounds good & Lasts long,-1
Perfect,-1
It keeps stopping and playing when listening to music,-1
The sound is awosome,-1
Good value for money,-1
Excellent Quality,-1
Works perfectly fine,-1
Its as good as advertised. Using it for over a week now and it's doing great so far,-1
I'm enjoying the product,-1
The pods are nice....almost just as advertised. The ear tips make the pods overly large and a tight fit in the ear canal. So technically u can't use it in the bass mode and enjoy comfort.,-1
Works as advertised. Fits conveniently in the ears. Excellent sound quality. Long lasting battery life. However the case doesn't have a strap for easy carry.,-1
"Amazing sound, incredible bass and long lasting battery life. Oraimo really went all out for this one????????",-1
Awesome,-1
"i love this product , and i use it all day. clear call quality and fashionable case.

works really cool.

BIG UP to ORAIMO",-1
Excellent,-1
Just enjoy the sounds,-1
"Enjoying the superb battery life , only eartips is giving me problem",-1
"If you're not ready for very intense bass, stay away!",-1
Portable and easy to use,-1
"This free pod is not comfortable in the ear when use with the rubber, without the rubber sound, is terrible but comfortable.",-1
"It’s perfect, sound it’s okay and the delivery is as dated",-1
It is amazing,-1
Quality product,-1
Nice output,-1
Got what I ordered .,-1
It’s okay and sounds really good,-1
Just as it promises ...thumbs up for oraimo..2baba,-1
Amazing noise cancellation and very good output......Best buy so far this year!,-1
Great improvement from the previous version.,-1
It has been a good experience using the Oraimo freepods 3. For a while now. I'd recommend it for anyone on a budget for a quality airbuds,-1
Works well and fit well to the hearing,-1
"Good, I can say the call quality really improved Buh bass not so much and doesn’t seem to have ENC",-1
It's okay so far,-1
"I've been rocking these for over a week now and I must say; they are incredible.
I tested them out to the max volume for 5 hours straight and they've never died on me. 
One thing I'd love to see though is a carrying case i can clip to my trousers easily. 

Oraimo really did good on this one.

PS: Without the eartips on, you won't feel the full power of the bass. SO, I recommend leaving the eartips on.",-1
Good sound and battery life.,-1
One humid,-1
Nice device,-1
It has a good call quality n also noise canceling good bass at the left ear,-1
The sound's great,-1
The product was indeed amazing,-1
Beautiful piece of sound device,-1
"Came as expected..good quality, i love it..oraimo forever",-1
The Sound quality is excellent and it's the same sound quality I get on my AirPods Pro when the Bass mode is used.,-1
The sound from the buds  is just cool and amazing,-1
I think this is the best thing that has entered my ear. For me it's all round perfect. Exactly as advertised. The environmental noise canceling is really a good touch.,-1
Works perfectly and the battery life is great,-1
Good product with quality tech,-1
the two ear pods not peering together again after few days,-1
"Just what I expected. The sound is clear, clean and the connectivity is superb. I recommend it for everyone. Thumbs up Jumia and Oraimo",-1
very good stuff,-1
Awesome sounds. Fit well. Great quality too,-1
I can't express my love for this Oraimo Pod 3...sweet in the middle. The bass is fantastic ????,-1
The best for me so far..,-1
It is exactly as described both physically and in performance,-1
Everything about it from it's packaging till it's bass,-1
Love it. xxx the noise cancellation is great,-1
"The Earbuds sounds really nice. The sound was so clear, not muddy and the bass is fire ????",-1
This is simply the best.,-1
Nice quality ????,-1
"It's pretty an awesome buds. But the bass, not to ""my"" satisfaction anyways...",-1
Happy to lay my hands on it,-1
"Really love this product. I just want to keep enjoying my music once it's one. The battery is another factor, it's really amazing and long lasting. I've not charged since I started using on 3 days ago. I strongly recommend this product!",-1
Low consuming power and fitted,-1
Nice…can’t wait to see what comes next.,-1
The product is actually what they say it is.,-1

I cant believe i got it at this price

Thanks to Oriamo and Jumia store",-1
"I really love this freepod 3, it's a total upgrade of the freepod 2....The noise cancellation and also bass is top notch",-1
Battery life and sound quality is out of this life,-1
"The freepods 3 delivery was fast, good packaging, sleek case, good ear fit pods, bass is on point and battery life is on point ✨. It's really worth the hype.",-1
It’s really dope i love it it’s strong and quality,-1
Get it! I transitioned from the freepods 2 to this one and I absolutely love it. ENC works as it should and the added bass is lovely. Awareness mode isn't as good as the freepods 2 but still an overall great buy,-1
